Features:


  Generic Scene Saving and Loading:


  Scene Relationships:
  - Parents
  - Children


  Procedural UI Generation:
    
    Node Distance:
    - use a circle
    
    Node Direction:
    - use a vector
    
    Node Redraws:
    - Add/Remove Nodes

    Node Color:
    - Choose from pallete?
    - rand?
      
    Node Paths:
    - line segments
    
    Node Highlights:
    - Show selection
  
  
  Navigation:
  - zoom in/out
  - panning
  - pointing/indicating
  - juicy movement


  Juice:
  - laggy camera/bounce/sway/drift
  - every movement tweened
  - visual starfield/reactive background/parallax
  - light up paths

  Sound/Music:
  - System Shock 2 Command 3

Saving Techniques:
  

  Differences:
  - saving entire scene change after change?
  - saving actions taken in scene? (Logical/JSON)
  

  Snapshots:
  - save entire scene?
  - save logical state (Logical/JSON)?
  

  Master Saves:
  - Use Logical Saves (Logical/JSON) with Master Save (Scene)
  - Apply logical state to master scene




Architecture of Time Tree:
  
  
  Recursion:
  - Time Trees within Time Tree?
  - Maybe not great idea
  - do save-scenes then have their own time-trees?




Crazy Ideas:


  Move View not Player:
  - we are *choosing* where to go first
  - then we have the player move along the path to do so
  - or force player to move up/down tree to get to target location
  - or "bind" player to the "track"
  - make them have to move to where they want to go
  - or maybe limit how far they can look


  Alter Music:
  - moving forward in time: play normally
  - moving backward in time: play backward
  - stopped: silence/slow

Questions:


  How Should things be saved?:
    
    Per Scene?:
    - each scene remembers its children and its parents
    
    Per Graph?:
    - Graph of all scenes is saved
  

  What should be saved?:
  - Scene Files?
  - Resource Files?
  - Custom JSON?


  How should we reference?:
    
    Folder-Names:
    - Where to find the tree
    - unecessary
  
    File-Names:
    - Where to find in the folder
    - use this
    - assumes root name

    Scene-Names:

    Root-Names:
    - Name of Root Object to target and load

  Rails Movement:
  - Dont use path2d
  - Use coordinates
  - Use agent
  - Capture player inout
  - Store as intentional vector
  - Compare vector to possible directions
  - Move towards available targets
  - Scenes saves as targets
  - Available targets from possible states and originating state

  Drawing:
  - Dont use canvas
  - Use StaticBody2D
  - Use Circle Radius
  - Use Direction Vector
  - Use Random Color

  Movement:
  - Space (Hold): Start Time Travel (Zoom In)
  - Enter (Hold): Choose Target (Zoom In)
  - Wasd: Pan/Direction

  Choosing Direction:
  - Have Circle Radius around every target
  - While in radius, set direction out
  - Play loose with player effect


  Lighting along path:
  - Make it spooky


  Time Travel Music:
  - think Cyberspace from System Shock
  - Esp. with the new System Shock Selected Midi
  - Maybe slowed down and quieted System Shock 2 tracks?:
    - System Shock 2 Operations deck (slow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebbabJBALw
  - I envision a dark, dark, dark place
  - that the place without space
  - and lines without times
  - is but cold, shimmering, glittering darkness
  - against the bright lines of time
  - but exiting those lines
  - one shatters the lines, slight
  - and pollutes the silence with noise
  - the cold, haunting, echoing tune of time
  - a clock, grind
  - an overwhelming mechanic grind, assured, calm, absolute
  - themes:
    - System Shock 2 - Command 3 (Remaster): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFTeyFo07q0
    - too techno
    - System Shock 2 OST - Command 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcaQaoqJ5vs
    - the original. much better.
    - hurts to listen to slowed down
    - some really heavy distortion. shame.


  System Shock Minigames:
  - Note these are needed to open doors/deactivate traps, etc
  

  System Shock Life System:
  - Saves/Load, Restore Stations
  - can become corrupted


  Certain Music Video:
  - See Video/Time as 3D shape unfolding


  Train Tracks:
  - "godot roller coaster"
  - because we will be moving *along* the tree...
  - anything with "tracks"
  - "move along path"
  - "path follower"
  - "unity train game"

  notes:
  - Very useful, how to make travel actual, and not just "a thing that happens"
  - make it more involved
  - compare to time travel?
  - make analogy of time-travel = space-travel
  - note use of small mechanics to reinforce major mechanics

  notes:
  - Excellent breakdown of a bad game
  - Pass on to Cosmic Engine
  - talk about grind, time travel and differentiating from Save Scumming
  - Talk about adding Quality of Life enhancements to make the game better between saves
  - (Essentially, pursue a Prey (2017) style of saves, that arent total)
  - ((Idea is, some stuff saved separately, allow avoiding repeated content))

chrono elements:
  
  
  chrono-trigger:
  - listens for whether the user wants to go to the tree or not
  - isolates it from any other interface
  
  
  chrono-tree:
  - displays all connected scenes
  - can go to a particular scene from here
  
  
  chrono-logger:
  - saves the scene as the user plays through it
  - also holds scene relationship info
  - assumes we are saving a new scene EACH TIME
  - should have some sort of ACTIONS which it TRACKS
  - or else actions which need to be recorded should EMIT a SIGNAL
  - for clarity's sake, probably best to keep this separate from chrono-trigger


  question:
  - will trigger and logger ever be exculsive?
  - or must one always be with the other?
  - it may be better to just comine them into one object






saving:


  scenes:
  - currently my "test.tscn" has 9,900 characters and is 10 KB in size
  - an average scene might be... 50 KB at smallest
  - thats 20 saves per 1 MB
  - we are looking at A LOT of saves... say 300
  - 300 * 50 = 15 MB of storage
  - alternatively, we could try using some LOGICAL representation of the game state
  - such as a TRES
  - or objects could self-report what is important


  connections:
  - we could have some master file of all the connections between scenes
  - each scene could have some object to represent its children
  - or its parent
  - but this requires the chrono-tree to open EACH SAVE to build the full tree
  - this could take a long time!
  - is better if chrono-tree keeps track of relationships
  - it should get updated each time a new scene is created

    url:      https://godotengine.org/qa/5447/what-are-diffrence-between-scn-and-tsn-which-one-is-better
    status:   done
    notes:
    - tscn versus scn
    - try scn at some point....


  tres or tscn:
  - choose tscn
  - why?
  - because regardless of whatever format we use, mindfulness is absolutely required
  - tres simply requires the creator to explicitly state what they want saved and how they want to save/load it
  - tscn however handles this automatically, and includes everything
  - use of tscn requires careful thought!
  - must turn everything into a prefab and store elsewhere as much as possible
  - what our tscn in particular is describing is the LAYOUT and VALUES of entities
  - even a TRES does the exact same thing
  - but! TSCN opens natively in the editor, ready to go
  - so you just need to be SMART about how you use it.
  - also, maybe some function that can detect if an asset stays together/does not change would be useful
  - so it can automatically export things to prefabs, and simply reference them, rather than constantly copying them
  - obviously, making significant changes to a prefab can be costly
  - also important to track dependencies between auto-generated prefabs....
  - hnnnnggggg
  - ok, maybe not worth the effort
  - BUT! If we limit the users ability to significantly alter prefabs, we should be fine
  - also define these prefabs sooner, and elminate any native resources to the scene


  our test case:
  - just needs to know 3 things
  - black ball position:  Vector3
  - white ball position:  Vector3
  - who's turn it is:     NodePath







saving connections:


  scene:
  - saves stuff inside itself
  - save to a hash (probably just an integer)


  tree:
  - builds a complete map of all connections
  - must update/add/remove these
  - must build ui from these
  - this can be a singleton, always running in the background
  - then when chrono-tree is called, we build it from this
  - other advantage is its just FileRefs and NodePaths
  - so small Scene to save as result
  - ACTUALLY!
  - we dont need NodePath!
  - we just need to add things as children!
  - which means the logger in each scene needs to know:
    - where to save scene (easy)
    - update the time-tree relationships (instantiate new "Save", set "File" to our save, add as child to last save)
