Title: Plan




Features:


  Generic Scene Saving and Loading:


  Scene Relationships:
  - Parents
  - Children


  Procedural UI Generation:
    
    Node Distance:
    - use a circle
    
    Node Direction:
    - use a vector
    
    Node Redraws:
    - Add/Remove Nodes

    Node Color:
    - Choose from pallete?
    - rand?
      
    Node Paths:
    - line segments
    
    Node Highlights:
    - Show selection
  
  
  Navigation:
  - zoom in/out
  - panning
  - pointing/indicating
  - juicy movement


  Juice:
  - laggy camera/bounce/sway/drift
  - every movement tweened
  - visual starfield/reactive background/parallax
  - light up paths


  Effects:
  - arrange scene screenshots along path
  - zoom in/out of scene screenshots on load/escape
  

  Sound/Music:
  - System Shock 2 Command 3
  - Natural Selection Ambient
  - System Shock Cyberspace Arranged




Saving Techniques:
  

  Differences:
  - saving entire scene change after change?
  - saving actions taken in scene? (Logical/JSON)
  

  Snapshots:
  - save entire scene?
  - save logical state (Logical/JSON)?
  

  Master Saves:
  - Use Logical Saves (Logical/JSON) with Master Save (Scene)
  - Apply logical state to master scene




Architecture of Time Tree:
  
  
  Recursion:
  - Time Trees within Time Tree?
  - Maybe not great idea
  - do save-scenes then have their own time-trees?




Crazy Ideas:


  Move View not Player:
  - we are *choosing* where to go first
  - then we have the player move along the path to do so
  - or force player to move up/down tree to get to target location
  - or "bind" player to the "track"
  - make them have to move to where they want to go
  - or maybe limit how far they can look


  Alter Music:
  - moving forward in time: play normally
  - moving backward in time: play backward
  - stopped: silence/slow

Questions:


  How Should things be saved?:
    
    Per Scene?:
    - each scene remembers its children and its parents
    
    Per Graph?:
    - Graph of all scenes is saved
  

  What should be saved?:
  - Scene Files?
  - Resource Files?
  - Custom JSON?


  How should we reference?:
    
    Folder-Names:
    - Where to find the tree
    - unecessary
  
    File-Names:
    - Where to find in the folder
    - use this
    - assumes root name

    Scene-Names:

    Root-Names:
    - Name of Root Object to target and load

  Rails Movement:
  - Dont use path2d
  - Use coordinates
  - Use agent
  - Capture player inout
  - Store as intentional vector
  - Compare vector to possible directions
  - Move towards available targets
  - Scenes saves as targets
  - Available targets from possible states and originating state

  Drawing:
  - Dont use canvas
  - Use StaticBody2D
  - Use Circle Radius
  - Use Direction Vector
  - Use Random Color

  Movement:
  - Space (Hold): Start Time Travel (Zoom In)
  - Enter (Hold): Choose Target (Zoom In)
  - Wasd: Pan/Direction

  Choosing Direction:
  - Have Circle Radius around every target
  - While in radius, set direction out
  - Play loose with player effect


  Lighting along path:
  - Make it spooky


  Time Travel Music:
  - think Cyberspace from System Shock
  - Esp. with the new System Shock Selected Midi
  - Maybe slowed down and quieted System Shock 2 tracks?:
    - System Shock 2 Operations deck (slow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebbabJBALw
  - I envision a dark, dark, dark place
  - that the place without space
  - and lines without times
  - is but cold, shimmering, glittering darkness
  - against the bright lines of time
  - but exiting those lines
  - one shatters the lines, slight
  - and pollutes the silence with noise
  - the cold, haunting, echoing tune of time
  - a clock, grind
  - an overwhelming mechanic grind, assured, calm, absolute
  - themes:
    - System Shock 2 - Command 3 (Remaster): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFTeyFo07q0
    - too techno
    - System Shock 2 OST - Command 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcaQaoqJ5vs
    - the original. much better.
    - hurts to listen to slowed down
    - some really heavy distortion. shame.


  System Shock Minigames:
  - Note these are needed to open doors/deactivate traps, etc
  

  System Shock Life System:
  - Saves/Load, Restore Stations
  - can become corrupted


  Certain Music Video:
  - See Video/Time as 3D shape unfolding


  Train Tracks:
  - "godot roller coaster"
  - because we will be moving *along* the tree...
  - anything with "tracks"
  - "move along path"
  - "path follower"
  - "unity train game"

  notes:
  - handy for others, esp non-coders as to why some things arent working






chrono elements:
  
  
  chrono-trigger:
  - listens for whether the user wants to go to the tree or not
  - isolates it from any other interface
  
  
  chrono-tree:
  - displays all connected scenes
  - can go to a particular scene from here
  
  
  chrono-logger:
  - saves the scene as the user plays through it
  - also holds scene relationship info
  - assumes we are saving a new scene EACH TIME
  - should have some sort of ACTIONS which it TRACKS
  - or else actions which need to be recorded should EMIT a SIGNAL
  - for clarity's sake, probably best to keep this separate from chrono-trigger


  question:
  - will trigger and logger ever be exculsive?
  - or must one always be with the other?
  - it may be better to just comine them into one object






saving:


  scenes:
  - currently my "test.tscn" has 9,900 characters and is 10 KB in size
  - an average scene might be... 50 KB at smallest
  - thats 20 saves per 1 MB
  - we are looking at A LOT of saves... say 300
  - 300 * 50 = 15 MB of storage
  - alternatively, we could try using some LOGICAL representation of the game state
  - such as a TRES
  - or objects could self-report what is important


  connections:
  - we could have some master file of all the connections between scenes
  - each scene could have some object to represent its children
  - or its parent
  - but this requires the chrono-tree to open EACH SAVE to build the full tree
  - this could take a long time!
  - is better if chrono-tree keeps track of relationships
  - it should get updated each time a new scene is created

    status:   done
    notes:
    - tscn versus scn
    - try scn at some point....
    - scn is COMPRESSED tscn
    - stored as BINARY, and not TEXT (t="text" in tscn)


  tres or tscn:
  - choose tscn
  - why?
  - because regardless of whatever format we use, mindfulness is absolutely required
  - tres simply requires the creator to explicitly state what they want saved and how they want to save/load it
  - tscn however handles this automatically, and includes everything
  - use of tscn requires careful thought!
  - must turn everything into a prefab and store elsewhere as much as possible
  - what our tscn in particular is describing is the LAYOUT and VALUES of entities
  - even a TRES does the exact same thing
  - but! TSCN opens natively in the editor, ready to go
  - so you just need to be SMART about how you use it.
  - also, maybe some function that can detect if an asset stays together/does not change would be useful
  - so it can automatically export things to prefabs, and simply reference them, rather than constantly copying them
  - obviously, making significant changes to a prefab can be costly
  - also important to track dependencies between auto-generated prefabs....
  - hnnnnggggg
  - ok, maybe not worth the effort
  - BUT! If we limit the users ability to significantly alter prefabs, we should be fine
  - also define these prefabs sooner, and elminate any native resources to the scene


  our test case:
  - just needs to know 3 things
  - black ball position:  Vector3
  - white ball position:  Vector3
  - who's turn it is:     NodePath







saving connections:


  scene:
  - saves stuff inside itself
  - save to a hash (probably just an integer)


  tree:
  - builds a complete map of all connections
  - must update/add/remove these
  - must build ui from these
  - this can be a singleton, always running in the background
  - then when chrono-tree is called, we build it from this
  - other advantage is its just FileRefs and NodePaths
  - so small Scene to save as result
  - ACTUALLY!
  - we dont need NodePath!
  - we just need to add things as children!
  - which means the logger in each scene needs to know:
    - where to save scene (easy)
    - update the time-tree relationships (instantiate new "Save", set "File" to our save, add as child to last save)

    notes:
    - check the ffmpeg instructions
    - very useful





tracking change:
- two major ways of tracking changes:
    1: Save everything each time
    2: Save only the things that change each time
- Tracking Everything:
  - Emphasis on storing references to things
  - Emphasis on making save as small as possible
- Tracking Changes:
  - ADD, REMOVE, CHANGE
  - this requires us to do a fair bit of engineering within godot, to incrementally edit a scene
  - but is far more powerful and generic then using custom full-save TRES's
  - why?
  - because we dont need to specify it for ecery single new feature we add
  - this automatically supports whatever we add
  - we also dont need to worry about the scene appearing particularly cluttered with native assets




next big idea:


  parts:

    users:
    - have a SAVES folder
    - have USER folders within this folder
    - each USER is a single playthrough
    - each USER folder has SAVE files (0.tscn - n.tscn)
    - each USER folder has one TREE file (tree.tscn)
    - the TREE stores relationships between SAVEs
    - this allows per-user ease of management
    
    ontology:
    - save relation of this save with other saves in a separate file
    - this is called a TREE
    - why 1 file:
      - if save ontology in EACH SAVE, will require opening and loading
      - HUNDREDS of saves
      - EACH TIME the time-tree needs to be loaded
      - also makes it harder to modify the ontology if distributed across all these files
    
    contents:
    - each SAVE is either a TRES or a TSCN
    - each SAVE has 3 CATEGORIES:
        ADD:  When something new is instantiated into the scene (add this)
        DROP: When something is removed from the scene (drop this)
        SUB:  When something changes in the scene (substitute this for this)
    - if TRES:
      - does not allow opening natively, will require separate saver/loader
      - still better than plain JSON (can save native stuff without much boilerplate)
    - if TSCN:
      - allows opening the save file in editor natively
      - will appear as 3 NODES: [add, drop, sub]
      - each NODE will have instance of referenced SCENE-NODE with applied changes (if SUB)
    
    naming:
    - each SAVE is given an INTEGER name
    - this name is INCREMENTED per SAVE
    - the last known SAVE's NAME is saved in the TREE file
    - (allows ease of adding new saves, as do not need to inspect directory for highest save number)

    applying and removing changes:
    - will be most sophisticated part of this
    - need some mechanism that creates scenes from script
    - can add/remove stuff from reading a TSCN


  implementation:

    scene saving:
    - avoid singletons where possible
    - instead, have chrono-logger in scene
    - chrono-logger notices changes to components it is told to watch for (maybe?)
    - or maybe it notices everything
    - when make new save, have chrono-logger open tree.tscn and add the new save with child ref's

    ontology representation:
    - if TSCN, can represent as NODEs within NODES
    - where each NODE is a SAVE
    - where the NAME of each NODE is an INTEGER (corresponds with name of SAVE file)
    - where the CHILDREN of each NODE are the CHILDREN of each SAVE (branch)
    - now, we can either store a REFERENCE to each save FILE from each NODE
    - or, we can make part of the time-tree loader a file-fetcher and handler

  
  new names:
    
    not enough to have all these "trees":
      chrono-tree:  the SPACE a player navigates around in
      tree.tscn:    the ONTOLOGY of saves a user makes
      "*save.tscn": the COLLECTION of saves that populate a time-tree
    
    from here on out, use these terms:
      
      chrono-space:
        type:     scene
        purpose:  PLAY
        relationships:
        - LOADS: chrono-tree
        - USED-BY: player
        description:
        - the procedurally-generated user-interface to the structure of saves
        - player moves around on rails in here
        - various time-effects, gameplay happens
        elements:
          canvas: Cool background for player to move across
          player: a cursor the player moves around the canvas
          nodes:
          - each save file is drawn as one of these
          - player can "enter" or "exit" these
          paths:
          - generated and drawn between nodes
          - player moves along these
          - this is where primary gameplay in this scene resides
      
      chrono-tree:
        type:     SCENE
        purpose:  DATA
        relationships:
        - USED-BY: chrono-space
        - TRACKS: chrono-saves
        - PLAYER: creates this through battle-gameplay
        description:
        elements:
          last-id:  INTEGER of last save game (what to use as NEXT save NAME)
          tree:     NODE-TREE of saves and their relationships
      
      chrono-save:
        type:     SCENE
        purpose:  DATA
        relationships:
        - USED-BY: chrono-tree
        description:
        - the differences between battle-scene
        elements:
          add:  NEW items to add
          drop: OLD items to remove
          sub:  OLD items to replace, change of mesh, etc





  Logging:


    what:
    - what if we "logged saves"?
    - what would htis look like?
    - what already exists?


    terms:
    - unity incremental saves
    - godot logging
    - godot scene logging
    - unity scene logging
    - godot save to stream
    - unity streaming saves
    - godot streaming scenes
    - godot log to tscn
    - godot log to tres


    questions:
    - what does streaming to/from tscn/tres/json look like?
    - what has been tried in the past?
    - "gron", a regex-like for JSON, converts the json into this: !python |
        foo = {}
        foo.bar = "baz"
        foo.baz = []
        foo.baz[0] = 1

      - seems horribly verbose for some fairly basic operations




  scenes not files:
  - we could save all saves as separate SCENES within the PLAYER save....
  - so, instead of maintaining a directory of separate saves
  - just put everything on the same node-tree structure
  - copy the battle scene, make this the root node
  - OR!
  - have tree.tscn with tree.gd REFERENCE the battle scene and copy it like that!
  - (makes an instance on first use of tree/first play)
