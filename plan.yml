Features:


  Generic Scene Saving and Loading:


  Scene Relationships:
  - Parents
  - Children


  Procedural UI Generation:
    
    Node Distance:
    - use a circle
    
    Node Direction:
    - use a vector

Saving Techniques:
  

  Differences:
  - saving entire scene change after change?
  - saving actions taken in scene? (Logical/JSON)
  

  Snapshots:
  - save entire scene?
  - save logical state (Logical/JSON)?
  

  Master Saves:
  - Use Logical Saves (Logical/JSON) with Master Save (Scene)
  - Apply logical state to master scene




Architecture of Time Tree:
  
  
  Recursion:
  - Time Trees within Time Tree?
  - Maybe not great idea
  - do save-scenes then have their own time-trees?




Crazy Ideas:


  Move View not Player:
  - we are *choosing* where to go first
  - then we have the player move along the path to do so
  - or force player to move up/down tree to get to target location
  - or "bind" player to the "track"
  - make them have to move to where they want to go
  - or maybe limit how far they can look


  Alter Music:
  - moving forward in time: play normally
  - moving backward in time: play backward
  - stopped: silence/slow

Questions:


  How Should things be saved?:
    
    Per Scene?:
    - each scene remembers its children and its parents
    
    Per Graph?:
    - Graph of all scenes is saved
  

  What should be saved?:
  - Scene Files?
  - Resource Files?
  - Custom JSON?


  How should we reference?:
    
    Folder-Names:
    - Where to find the tree
    - unecessary
  
    File-Names:
    - Where to find in the folder
    - use this
    - assumes root name

    Scene-Names:

    Root-Names:
    - Name of Root Object to target and load



Notes:


  Time Travel Music:
  - think Cyberspace from System Shock
  - Esp. with the new System Shock Selected Midi
  - Maybe slowed down and quieted System Shock 2 tracks?:
    - System Shock 2 Operations deck (slow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ebbabJBALw
  - I envision a dark, dark, dark place
  - that the place without space
  - and lines without times
  - is but cold, shimmering, glittering darkness
  - against the bright lines of time
  - but exiting those lines
  - one shatters the lines, slight
  - and pollutes the silence with noise
  - the cold, haunting, echoing tune of time
  - a clock, grind
  - an overwhelming mechanic grind, assured, calm, absolute
  - themes:
    - System Shock 2 - Command 3 (Remaster): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFTeyFo07q0
    - too techno
    - System Shock 2 OST - Command 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcaQaoqJ5vs
    - the original. much better.
    - hurts to listen to slowed down
    - some really heavy distortion. shame.


  System Shock Minigames:
  - Note these are needed to open doors/deactivate traps, etc
  

  System Shock Life System:
  - Saves/Load, Restore Stations
  - can become corrupted


  Certain Music Video:
  - See Video/Time as 3D shape unfolding


  Train Tracks:
  - "godot roller coaster"
  - because we will be moving *along* the tree...
  - anything with "tracks"
  - "move along path"
  - "path follower"
  - "unity train game"

  type:   [game-dev, talk]
  policy: public
  notes:
  - Very useful, how to make travel actual, and not just "a thing that happens"
  - make it more involved
  - compare to time travel?
  - make analogy of time-travel = space-travel
  - note use of small mechanics to reinforce major mechanics

  notes:
  - Excellent breakdown of a bad game
  - Pass on to Cosmic Engine
  - talk about grind, time travel and differentiating from Save Scumming
  - Talk about adding Quality of Life enhancements to make the game better between saves
  - (Essentially, pursue a Prey (2017) style of saves, that arent total)
  - ((Idea is, some stuff saved separately, allow avoiding repeated content))
