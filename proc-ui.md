## How to Stream Changes?
- dont save the entire state
- but do save "sync shots" occasionally (esp. on game exit)
- do save *changes* between scenes
- do save *generic* objects using *generic* scene exportation



## Ideas
- "godot roller coaster"
  - because we will be moving *along* the tree...
  - anything with "tracks"
- "move along path"
- "path follower"
- "unity train game"
