        - this is a *plain*, not thought-out example
        - note that there are almost no prefab instances

- name:   test_2.tscn
  notes:
        - this one we moved stuff out to prefabs
        - so the rows, columns, floor, camera, music objects are now a single prefab
        - we also made the balls a prefab instance, and change the material on one
        - in the "res://test/" we have "board.tscn" and "ball.tscn" to account for this
        - these have to be loaded in
        - another possible problem is the program folder ("res://") needs to be constant
        - so that saves ("user://") can be anywhere and still load those assets
