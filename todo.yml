  separate time travel:
  - make time travel separate from all other components in scene
  - make "Chrono-Trigger" element for any generic scene
  - embed as child, listen for "Page-Up" event
  - also listen for CONTEXT, know when can be activated
  - handles saving on its own
  - handles exiting/switching on its own

  - log actions
  - save scene (full)

  - make game exit separate from other components
  - follow same pattern as chrono-trigger
