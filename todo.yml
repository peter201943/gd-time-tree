todo:


  separate time travel:
  - make time travel separate from all other components in scene
  - make "Chrono-Trigger" element for any generic scene
  - embed as child, listen for "Page-Up" event
  - also listen for CONTEXT, know when can be activated
  - handles saving on its own
  - handles exiting/switching on its own
  - must be a scene (refs to resources)


  implement saving:
  - scene
  - connections (singleton)




done:


  separate game exit:
  - make game exit separate from other components
  - follow same pattern as chrono-trigger


  way of saving:
  - log actions (hard)
  - save scene (full) (easy)
  - save res (partial) (less easy, questionable)


  fix files:
  - chrono-node
  - chrono-tree
  - pause
  - test
  - credits
  - plan
  - project
  - readme
